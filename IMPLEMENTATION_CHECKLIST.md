# Implementation Checklist

This checklist tracks the implementation of the core features of the agentic CLI assistant.

## Phase 1: Core Foundation & TUI
- [x] **1.1 Project Setup:** Python backend and Node.js frontend directories created.
- [x] **1.2 Core Dependencies:** All necessary Python and Node.js libraries installed.
- [x] **1.3 Advanced TUI:** Implemented a multi-panel TUI with regions for logs, active files, and a main content/diff view.
- [x] **1.4 WebSocket Bridge:** Established real-time, bidirectional communication.

## Phase 2: User Input & Command Handling
- [x] **2.1 Prompt Parser:** Created a robust parser to handle commands (`/load`, `/refactor`, `/commit`), file tags (`@file`), and natural language instructions.
- [x] **2.2 Path Validation:** Implemented a `PathValidator` for safe file handling.
- [x] **2.3 Command Dispatcher:** Built a central dispatcher to route user input to the correct handlers.

## Phase 3: Advanced Context Engine
- [x] **3.1 Incremental Context Builder:** Implemented a refinement loop to build high-confidence context before running agents.
- [x] **3.2 AST-Aware Chunking & Search:** Implemented intelligent code chunking and structural search capabilities.
- [x] **3.3 Enriched Vector Store:** Upgraded the ChromaDB store to include rich metadata for better semantic search.

## Phase 4: State & Agent Orchestration
- [x] **4.1 State Management:** Implemented a structured `AgentState` to manage the complete session.
- [x] **4.2 Persistent Conversation History:** Created a token-aware `ConversationHistory` class that persists to disk.
- [x] **4.3 Hybrid Search Agent:** Built a `CodeSearchAgent` that intelligently chooses between AST and semantic search.
- [x] **4.4 Diff Agent:** Created a `DiffAgent` to propose LLM-driven code changes.
- [x] **4.5 AST-based Refactor Agent:** Implemented a `RefactorAgent` for safe, structural code modifications.

## Phase 5: Finalization & Version Control
- [x] **5.1 Diff Confirmation Loop:** Implemented the full frontend/backend workflow for user approval of changes.
- [x] **5.2 Change Summarizer Agent:** Implemented an agent to summarize code diffs.
- [x] **5.3 Conventional Commit Agent:** Implemented an agent to generate commit messages.
- [x] **5.4 Version Control Agent:** Implemented an agent to generate final `git` commands.
- [ ] **5.5 Test Generator Agent:** Implement an agent to automatically generate unit tests for changes.
- [ ] **5.6 Advanced Workflow Runner:** Fully implement the conditional logic and deliberation loops in the `WorkflowRunner`.
